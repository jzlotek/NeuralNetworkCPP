# NeuralNetworkCPP
C++ Neural Network

This is my first attempt at trying to learn how a neural net works from the inside out. It is very rudimentary right now and there are many problems with it which I am trying to fix.

Currently sets up the net with given layer params (check the main.cpp). Back propagation is a little buggy and requires work.


Requirements:
* g++


To compile:
* g++ cpp/main.cpp
 OR
* make
